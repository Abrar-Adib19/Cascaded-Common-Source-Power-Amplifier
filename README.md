This work represents the design and optimization of a CMOS Power Amplifier using Cadence Virtuoso (90 nm technology) Software which operates in the frequency range between the Ku-band and K-band (16.8-18.8 GHz). The amplifier was initially designed as a single stage system, and Sparameter analysis was performed to evaluate its performance. However, the results showed that the single stage PA did not meet the required specifications. To address this, an input matching network and an output matching network were developed utilizing Z-parameter analysis, enhancing its performance in the subsequent S-parameter study. A double stage amplifier was then developed, incorporating an interstage matching network in the form of an LC tank circuit. The final design produced an Gain (S21) of 16.70 dB, S11 of -22.32 dB, S12 of -26.68 dB, and S22 of -17.79 dB at 17.80 GHz. Furthermore, the large signal analysis indicated an output 1dB compression point of about 11.54 dBm along with a saturated power (Psat) of around 12.20 dBm. The stability factor (K) and the noise figure was determined to be about 2.3 and 3.89 dB respectively in the operating region. Finally, the peak power-added efficiency (PAE) was found to be approximately 20%. The design demonstrates an effective implementation of matching networks and cascaded amplifier stages to attain good linearity,stability and overall performance in the inside Ku-band and K-band.
